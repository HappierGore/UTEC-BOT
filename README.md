Administrative bot for Universidad Tecnológica de Tulancingo

This bot is for administrate the basic things for an university, this will...

1. Show and allow to download the schedule of the student.
2. Give information of the student (If you are staff of teacher)
3. Allow to register using institutional email.
4. Allow to unbind a Discord account of an institutional email, basically, unregister.
5. Clear chat (If you are staff of teacher)

All data is simulated, and fake, just for testing and debugging.
This bot is not official for Universidad Tecnológica de Tulancingo.

Plans:
1. Send to the student to its next signature (video chat)
2. Give to user its actual notes
3. !me command to get information about your account.

The rest of the server is that, a server nicely organized to allow to students to find and take their classes and don't waste time looking for it. 
The bot is just for make easier the navigation and administration of data.
Hopelly, this project will grow and be a great and helpful tool.
